These Dockerfiles create ng-meta-profiler docker images that include all required data ready to be used.

Run `docker-compose build` to build all containers.
This operation will take several hours and requires ~300GB of disk space and 60GB of RAM.

These containers can then be used directly or via the convenience script [ng-meta-profiler.sh](https://github.com/ngless-toolkit/ng-meta-profiler/blob/master/ng-meta-profiler.sh).
